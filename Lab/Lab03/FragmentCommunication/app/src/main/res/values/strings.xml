    <string name="article1">Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake
        road, like I did, with a first listen to this song. Originally titled
        “Beatle Bop” and recorded in a single session that yielded four songs (the other three featured Tony Sheridan with the Beatles as a backing band), “Cry for a Shadow” is an instrumental written by Lennon and Harrison, which makes it unique to this day. John Lennon plays rhythm guitar, George Harrison plays lead guitar, Paul McCartney plays bass, and Pete Best plays drums. The sessions were produced by Bert Kaempfert in Hamburg, Germany, during the Beatles’ second visit from April through July of 1961 to play in the Reeperbahn-section clubs.</string>
    <string name="article2">At the same session, the Beatles played on “My Bonnie” (the first-ever single with Beatles playing), as the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan, originally a member of the Jets. The popularity of this single in Liverpool brought the Beatles to the attention of Brian Epstein, who worked in the NEMS record store and tried to meet demand for the disc. John Lennon then sings a fine “Ain’t She Sweet” (his first-ever released vocal).</string>
    <string name="article3">Hit the town in the cold of the night
Looking? round for the warmth of the light
There was fog on the road
So I guess no one saw me arriving
I was tired and awake for some time
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign
It said if you are alone
You can make this your home
If you want to, oww
Searching, searching
(For so long)
Searching
(Searching)
Searching, searching
(I just wanted to dance)
Searching
Stepped outta the night
It was brighter inside
Someone come and asked me my name
Taken back by surprise
When I saw with my eyes
A girl in a love is disguise
She said stop, stop, stop
Get out your heart
Havent got a lot
But play the part
Mister, stop, stop, stop
Get out your heart
What I have got is hot stuff
The night is ours
Coffee glass that had fell from my hand
Like a child couldnt quite understand
What was I doin? there
Far away from nowhere, on my own
I was tired and awake for some time
Just the light playing tricks with my mind
Was she there in a crowd
Was the music too loud, was I dreaming
Searching, searching
(For so long)
Searching
(I dont want romance)
(I just want my chance, searching)
Searching, searching
(Yeah)
Searching
Just came by here by chance
Only wanted to dance
No news, no her, no, no, no one
Taken back by surprise
Whats in front of my eyes
This girl in a loves disguise
She said stop, stop, stop
Get out your heart
Havent got a lot
But play the part
Mister, stop, stop, stop
Get out your heart
What Ive gots hot stuff
The night is ours</string>

    <string name="article5">There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice
I said Im travling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice

I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong
